519: The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
520: No traveller returns, puzzles the will
521: And makes us rather bear those ills we have
522: Than fly to others that we know not of?
523: Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
524: And thus the native hue of resolution
525: Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
526: And enterprises of great pith and moment
527: With this regard their currents turn awry,
528: And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
529: The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
530: Be all my sins remember'd!
